It is a good thing knowing how to code and make a functioning app, but it is better to know how to make a good looking, functioning app. Tonight I was looking at some resources and found [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-books-on-graphic-design-for-beginners), [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-to-learn-about-the-color-theory-for-graphic-and-web-designers) and [that](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-books-and-online-resources-about-color-theory) page on quora.

I am not a big fan of modern resources - for some reason, I prefer something that has passed the test of time and been around for a few decades.

One of the common denominator is [Interaction of Color by Joself Albers](https://www.amazon.com/Interaction-Color-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0300179359/ref=pd_rhf_dp_s_cp_9?ie=UTF8&refRID=184F1E9DA0P6SQV7CZ4W). I also saw that Yale publishing have an [app for that](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interaction-of-color-by-josef-albers-complete-edition/id771793818?mt=8).

I am going to pick it up and spend some time reading it.

Additionally, two other books that caught my eye:

- [Elements of Typographic Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Version-Anniversary/dp/0881792128/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=elements+of+typographic+style&qid=1441390910&sr=8-1)

- [Grid Systems in Graphic Design](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Communication/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=grid+systems+in+graphic+design&qid=1441390725&sr=8-1)
