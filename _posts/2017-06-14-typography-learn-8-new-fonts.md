I started reading [Grid Systems in Graphic Design](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Communication/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=grid+systems+in+graphic+design&qid=1441390725&sr=8-1). The first 24 pages of the book covers 9 classic fonts. I used Sketch App to take notes of some important points about each font and what they were used for.

There are a few good things gained from reading about typography. It gives me a starting point where to start. When I am choosing fonts, I would either choose one arbitrarily or pick the same fonts over and over again. Knowing the historical background of the fonts, and what they were used for helped me to choose fonts wiser.

Now if I wanted to make a commercial/ advertising app, I know I can rely on "Sans Serif" family. If I want to publish a piece of information (like this blog post), I can use "Times" or "Bodoni". For a title, I can use something like "Caslon" or "Garamond" in bold. 

What you can do today is, pick three different fonts that I listed above. One of them has to be "sans serif" family and the other one from "serif" family *(sans serif is devoid of ornaments/ end strokes)*. Where do you think you can apply each of those three fonts? Title page? Commercials? Information? Humor? News content?
