  <p>Once I asked my mentor how to be a great dev:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Ship code.</li>
      <li>Ship code.</li>
      <li>Ship code.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So I learned to ship code.</p>

  My first exposure to computing was when my dad bought a Windows 95 computer.
  I still remember when my cousin came to visit and created a Lycos email (using dial-up connection. I would seldom fought with my dad who needed to use the phone for work).

  My first programming language was Visual Basic, which I learned in 6th grade when my mom would take me to extracurricular CS course.
  Over the years, I was taught C and C++ in High School and Python in College. After I finished college, I self-taught myself Ruby and Javascript.
  I joined <a href="https://codepen.io/iggPen/">codepen</a> to learn more about HTML/CSS/JS and was blown away by what CSS/JS can do together.

<p>
  My current technology stack is Ruby on Rails and React.
  I use React-Native for mobile developments.
  I have experienced developing with Angular1, Ember, and vanilla JS as well.
