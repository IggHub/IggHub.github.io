title: Building Trust Through Connection Ch 4
---

An example of a new president in a medical industry company. He possesses excellent analytical  skill. He was just finished giving a speech about company merge; at the end he opened up a Q&A. A lady addressed her fear of people losing their jobs - people with families that moved from far places. Although this president was able to give a strong answer with good support, he failed to connect with her. It happened several times with other people who asked him questions. He answered all of them correctly and assuringly, but failed to *empathize*.

## Better replies

The person was a nice and caring guy. But he did not have *their hearts*. He should have replied to the woman something like this:

*"Wow, you've poured a lot of yours and other people's lives int othis. How long have you guys been going down this path?"*

*"Really... how many people have you moved? That must have been really hard to make that call, and also for them to do it. How did it go? Was the restructure messy?"*

*"I can see if I am in your shoes why you would be worried. They have got to be scared too... What have they been saying to you? I mean, they have had all this change and now another one... Anyone close to leaving?"*

*"So you're dealing with some people who must be really on pins and needles. I'm glad you're worried about them."*

*"Of course I can understand your concern. I would be feeling like that too. Let me tell you what my thoughts are on it, and then you tell me what that sounds like. Tell me if you think it will help them or if we need to understand more."*

That way he would have had them. Being nice is not enough. Being analytical is not enough. Being a problem-solver is not enough.

## Empathy

The word empathy comes from Greek words "in" and "feeling." Being right is not the highest value. Understanding and connecting with others is. True empathy occurs only When

> the other person udnerstand that you understand

It happens like this:

```
they talk -> you experience them -> you share what you've heard and experienced about their experiences -> they experience you haveing heard them -> they know that you are 'with them'
```

## Not-so-good replies

Having understood about empathy and better responses, here are some of the connection-killing replies:

*"Well, that's not going to be a problem"*

*"You won't have to worry about it"*

*"That won't get in the way"*

*"They will love it"*

Even if all of those things are true, they fail to connect with other people. They annihilate other person's reality and shut him/her down. It invalidates them.
