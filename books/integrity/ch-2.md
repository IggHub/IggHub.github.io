## Character, Integrity, and Reality

### Example1

A CEO has to choose to rid of his VP of sales or two key people would leave. Although this VP of sales make great number, there are other hidden costs in keeping him:

1. Consider CEO's duty and his hourly salary. It is a huge number. Each moment of the CEO is worth substantial amount
2. Multiply that number with the amount of time other people are talking to CEO (because of the issues related to this VP Sales person)
3. Add lost opportunity what you and other people could have dene
4. Add settlement amount plus hourly charges by the attourneys for the consultation regarding the problem this person is causing
5. Add the cost of finding two new VPs (who are about to leave if this sales VP stays), including lost business, work, and traction
6. Add the distraction caused by this problem to the whole company

After those numbers are added up, it becomes obvious what action to take.

## The Wake

Imagine sitting on a boat gliding across the ocean, watching the wake. What the wake looks like tells the boat and its direction. Everybody leaves a wake - what kind of wake do you leave?

The wake is what everybody leaves behind. It neither lies nor care about excuses. The best way to learn about somebody's wake is to ask two of his/ her previous managers.

## Character Definition, Makeup, and Ability

*Character = ability to meet the demands of reality*

Character can grow and character is "fixed", as fixed as a house structure. Once built, it will remain static. However, just as any structures can be remodeled, so can character.
