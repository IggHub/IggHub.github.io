1. The wuality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness. "He is known to be a man of integrity"

2. The state of being *whole* and *undivided*

3. The condition of being *unified, unimpaired,* or *sound in construction*

4. *Internal consistency* or *lack of corruption* in electronic data

The word itself is comprised of French and Latin that mean *intact, integrate, integral*, and *entirety*.

## Nature of Integrity

1. Face the need. There are no shortcuts, no fooling it - we need to possess the stuff that are required from us

2. Understand the real issue and able to diagnose the problem

3. Work towards full integration of character and wholeness as a person. Do things that we are designed to do, not the things are are not designed to do.

In Hebrew, character or integrity is translated to "virtue." Or Force. When the time comes, will I become the force that bring about fruit?
