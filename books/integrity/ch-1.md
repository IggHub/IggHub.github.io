# How to be successful

People who become leaders have the following 3 qualities:

1. Competencies
- Know their discipline
- Have sufficient head knowledge
- One can only fake it so long - so strive to become a master at the craft

2. Alliance builder
- Not networking - in fact, mere networking (getting to know someone to ask for job) is like leeching
- Able to make their piece bigger
- Know how partner with different types of people: investors, regulators, distribution, &c...

3. Character to not screw it up
- Personhood, integrity, and character are more important than the first two
- Many examples of large corporations (Emron, Anderson, Worldcom) who suffer catastrophes because the leader lacked character
- *"Who a person is will ultimately determine if their brains, talents, competence, energy, effort, deal-making abilities, and opportunities will succeed"*

**Summary:**

There are three things that successful people must have: competencies in their craft, ability to make their things bigger by forming alliance with other people, and having the right character. On the latter one the rest of qualities hinge on.
