Jekyll is a site generator solution that is tailored for blogs. It uses converters like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/_) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)(Shopify) renderers *(no really, you should totally check both!)*

If you have an active github account and want to set a blog, use Jekyll-powered github pages!

Check out [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and [Jekyll GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for more!
