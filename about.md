Hi there!
<h2>A New Code</h2>

In 2015, I saved up a decent amount of money enough to either replace my 11-year-old KIA Spectra or spend it on <a href="http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/in-n-out-prices/">2,898 In-N-Out double-double</a>. I chose neither and enrolled in <a href="https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp">Bloc's Full Stack web dev program</a> to learn new skill.

<em>I was wrong.</em>

I not <em>only</em> acquired a new skill, I discovered that I love coding. I built my first rails app ever: a simple reddit replica, <a href="https://sheltered-everglades-14741.herokuapp.com/">Bloccit</a>. Then I built my second, third, and more rails app on my own: a simple to-do list, <a href="https://murmuring-refuge-65573.herokuapp.com">Blocitoff</a>, a wiki SaaS app, <a href="https://mighty-journey-47111.herokuapp.com/"> Blocipedia</a>. I also learned a new world of API when working on <a href="https://github.com/igghub/kele">Kele</a>, my own ruby gem to access Bloc's API and <a href="https://github.com/igghub/todo-api">todo-api</a>, another todo list using API backend.

<h2>The Reality Strikes Back</h2>

This was 6 months after I graduated from University of California Riverside with my degree in Chemical Engineering. I just started working as a Quality Engineer. Should I pursue a different career outside of my degree?

<h2>Return Of The Dev</h2>

After consulting the devs from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Riverside-Ruby-User-Group/">Riverside Ruby Group</a> that I am a part with for almost a year, plus girlfriend (now wife), mentor at Bloc, and close friends, I decided to pursue what I love most.

<h2>The Learning Menace</h2>

One of the biggest challenges of studying a new skill while working an supporting a family is finding a time to learn. After much trial and error, I found my groove: I would spend 1/4 of my time building new project, 1/4 on reading new concept, 1/6 on coding challenge on codewars, 1/6 on SQL or CS material, and 1/6 on learning design (sketchapp/ CSS/ JS animation/ design concepts). (list the sources including JS CS concepts, cssrocks, hackdesign, sketchapp sources, &c. SQLzoo, sqllearn).

<h2>Attack Of The Fronts</h2>

The second part of Bloc's Full-Stack web development program is Frontend. I learned vanilla javascript by building <a href="https://tutor-tips-53668.netlify.com/">bloc-jams</a>, a web-based music player. I was introduced to angular framework when I <a href=
"https://smuggler-experience-66057.netlify.com/">refactored bloc-jams with angularjs</a>. I learned a little React building an <a href="https://igghub.github.io/react-fish/">online interactive menu</a>.


<h3>Q&A:</h3>

<p>Where is Revenge of the Sith?</p>

<em>I can't find anything that rhymes with Sith, so I omitted it :)</em>

<p>What do you do outside of coding?</p>
Spend time with wife. Play board games with people - favorite: Catan, mexican train, wolf. Walk the dog (show picture of Lexi). Handstand.

<p>What is your favorite donut flavor?</p>

<em>Boston Creme and peanut covered chocolate. I also like Kripy Kreme's classic glaze. Down the street; but every week we would try to find an new donut place. I loved donut so much I created an app to help me find donut location :)</em>

<p>Are you for hire?</p>

<em>Yes! I am currently looking for Rails / JS work. If you are/ know someone who are hiring, let me know at (email). Btw, my resume is here (link)</em>
